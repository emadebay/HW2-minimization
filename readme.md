Numerical Minimization of Function f(w1, w2)
This repository contains Python code to numerically minimize the function f(w1, w2) defined as:

f(w1, w2) = (x - w1)^2 + y(w2 - w2_1)^2

Problem Description
The goal is to implement gradient descent to find the minimum of the function f(w1, w2). This involves computing the partial derivatives of the function, implementing gradient descent with a fixed learning rate, and conducting experiments to analyze the impact of different initial values and learning rates on the optimization process.
